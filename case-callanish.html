                    Callanish is a Celtic Fusion band based in Salt Lake City, UT. Though active on social media, they wanted a dedicated space on the web where they could centralize their presence.

                    Being a designer (and the vocalist *ahem*), I pounced on the opportunity, excited to employ all of my burgeoning skills as a UX/UI Designer to make something unique, powerful, and engaging.

                <p>
                    As the primary designer, it was my duty to ensure as much effective work for my clients as possible within a short, sprint-based span of three weeks.
                    In those weeks, I checked in regularly with my team, who were working on their own individual projects in order to give and receive constructive feedback and moral support.

                    My responsibilities ran the gamut of a UX/UI Design sprint, from the general research that arose from first ideations, SWOT Analyses, and Client Interviews to the further use of Surveys, Card Sorting, Usability, and A/B Testing.
                    For the UI, I used Figma to build the initial wireframes, and found it capable of doing all the things I needed from then all the way up to the medium-fidelity prototype which amounted by the end of the sprint.

                <h2>The Survey</h2>
                <div class="fullSpan2"></div>
            <p>
                I found that many of my participants wanted their bands to have some kind of website, not just Social Media accounts or an Apple Music page. Nearly all of them, including the true fans of Celtic music, expressed a longing for better representation and diversity within the live music scene in Salt Lake City. 
            </p>
            <p>
                And of <i>course</i>! Why <i>not</i>? Celtic music: It's catchy, it bursts with passion and joie de vivre. It calms the soul, expunges the pain of the heart. So yes, diversity is a given, yet amongst the fans of Callanish, one of their biggest draws is our celebration of diversity and full representation within the music and the culture.

                <h2 class="points">

                <h2>On the Shoulders of Giants</h2>
                <p style="margin: 11% auto 16% auto;">
                    Although technically "competitive analysis" is what we UX/UI designers call this stage of the work, the nature of this particular project felt more collaborative, or inspirational if anything.  My intention was to look at a few other band websites to see what they did, and I used a typical SWOT protocol to do so; however, since Callanish believes more in collaboration that we do competition, I elected to drop the "T" which, in this case, stands for "Threat".

                    I devised two user stories for this project: One for the average user, and one for an event coordinator. I chose to focus on the event coordinator’s story due to the fact that in doing so, I’d also be covering all the bases for the average user.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Due to the nature of the project, it was a relatively straight-forward journey for this lovely person, but I still value the insights I gained from it, because along with the data gleaned from my survey, I had a good idea of the way the site should be structured for ease of use.

                Pretty Straightforward, right? But I found comfort in the logic!

                From there, I crafted a series of sketches describing how the site should be laid out.

                This was a most exciting experiment, and it helped me get a lay of the land I was about to create before committing to anything serious.
