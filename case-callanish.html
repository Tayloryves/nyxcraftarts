                <h2>Summary</h2>
                    Callanish is a Celtic Fusion band based in Salt Lake City, UT. Though active on social media, they wanted a dedicated space on the web where they could centralize their presence.
                    <p>
                    Being a designer (and the vocalist), I pounced on this opportunity like a fox in the snow. I offered to create this website for them, using all my skills as a UX/UI Designer to make something unique, powerful, and engaging.

                <img src="#">
                    I was happy to wear the big black hat for this project and assume responsibility for all of its facets from UX research to UI implementation.
                    As the primary designer, it was my duty to ensure as much effective work for my clients as possible within a short, sprint-based span of three weeks.
                    In those weeks, I checked in regularly with my team, who were working on their own individual projects in order to give and receive constructive feedback and moral support.
                <p>
                    My responsibilities ran the gamut of a UX/UI Design sprint, from the general research that arose from first ideations, SWOT Analyses, and Client Interviews to the further use of Surveys, Card Sorting, Usability, and A/B Testing.
                    For the UI, I used Figma to build the initial wireframes, and found it capable of doing all the things I needed from then all the way up to the medium-fidelity prototype which amounted by the end of the sprint.

                    I found that many of my participants wanted their bands to have some kind of website, not just Social Media accounts. Amongst those fans of Celtic music, they longed for better representation and diversity within the live music scene. 
                    <p>
                        Truly, those who are passionate about Celtic music are very diverse, but amongst the fans of Callanish, one of our biggest draws is our celebration of diversity within the music and the culture.

                    <p>
                    Due to the nature of the project, it was a relatively straight-forward journey for this lovely person, but I still value the insights I gained from it, because along with the data gleaned from my survey, I had a good idea of the way the site should be structured for ease of use.
