                    Callanish is a Celtic Fusion band based in Salt Lake City, UT. Though active on social media, they wanted a dedicated space on the web where they could centralize their presence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Being a designer (and the vocalist *ahem*), I pounced on the opportunity, excited to employ all of my burgeoning skills as a UX/UI Designer to make something unique, powerful, and engaging.

                    As the primary designer, it was my duty to ensure as much effective work for my clients as possible within a short, sprint-based span of three weeks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My responsibilities ran the gamut of a UX/UI Design sprint, from the general research that arose from first ideations, SWOT Analyses, and Client Interviews to the further use of Surveys, Card Sorting, Usability, and A/B Testing.

                <p>
                    For the UI, I used Figma to build the initial wireframes, and found it capable of doing all the things I needed from then all the way up to the medium-fidelity prototype which amounted by the end of the sprint.

            <p>
                I found that many of my participants wanted their bands to have some kind of website, not just Social Media accounts or an Apple Music page. Nearly all of them, including the true fans of Celtic music, expressed a longing for better representation and diversity within the live music scene in Salt Lake City. 
            </p>
            <p>
                And of <i>course</i>! Why <i>not</i>? Celtic music: It's catchy, it bursts with passion and joie de vivre. It calms the soul, expunges the pain of the heart. So yes, diversity is a given, yet amongst the fans of Callanish, one of their biggest draws is our celebration of diversity and full representation within the music and the culture.

                <p style="margin: 3% auto 5% auto;">
                    Although technically "competitive analysis" is what we UX/UI designers call this stage of the work, the nature of this particular project felt more collaborative, or inspirational if anything.  My intention was to look at a few other band websites to see what they did, and I used a typical SWOT protocol to do so; however, since Callanish believes more in collaboration that we do competition, I elected to drop the "T" which, in this case, stands for "Threat".

                <p>
                    I had a lot of fun coming up with a design for this project. As a band, we'd been wanting to badly to have a fully fledged website that served not only to provide the necessary content for our fans and interested parties to get to know us better, but also to speak to our personality, our values, in an implicit way that didn't seek to beat anyone over the head.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 11%;">
                    Through the application of design principles coupled with the insight of usability interviews, the journey up to this point was smooth, and although there were a couple of stumbles here and there, were it not for the skills obtained from UX/UI knowledge this project would have taken much longer, and the MVP result would have been far less seamless.
