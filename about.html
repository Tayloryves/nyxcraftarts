                    <p>Taylor Nyx is a multidisciplinary designer, artist, illustrator, musician, writer, massage therapist, hairstylist and health coach...<br>An <i>Homme du Renaissance</i>, whose many areas of knowledge and experience fit together to make a delightfully quirky mosiac held fast by a near unslakeable thirst for knowledge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He is currently a student of Thinkful, rapidly gaining skills in UX/UI Design, specializing in Frontend Development. But his range of skills stretch further still.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a Graphic Designer and Illustrator he's worked freelance for individual clients. So too has he done commission work as a fine artist, realizing the visions of those with imagination enough to conceive of a vision in the first place, but not necessarily possessed of the skills required to make such visions manifest on the physical plane. In this role, he's interpreted characters, scenes, and stories of all kinds to the delight of his clientele, and his audience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a Fine Artist, his inspiration stems from the likes of Frank Frazetta, Roberto Ferri, and J.C. Leyendecker most notably. He has a pennchant for the fantastic, the mysterious, the spiritual condensed into symbolic and romantic images that speak to the heart, tell a story, or express a state of mind in response to the vagaries of society.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Given his background as a massage therapist of over fifteen years, and a hairstylist of thirteen, he has formidable skills in customer service, communication, problem solving, and empathy.
